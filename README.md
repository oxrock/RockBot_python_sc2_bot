# RockBot_python_sc2_bot
This is a Starcraft 2 bot I made using the python sc2 api. This version is entirely rule based, there's no machine learning implementations as of yet.

the Python sc2 github can be located here: https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2
If you need a primer on understanding the api, I suggest you watch a helpful tutorial such as the one here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3LJ6VvpfgI
